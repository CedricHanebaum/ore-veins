v2.0.4

Changes:
 - Fixed indicators spawning on top of trees
 - Added 'ignore_liquids' option to indicators to spawn them under oceans / lakes.
 - Indicator generation should be generally smarter - no more replacing solid blocks when it shouldn't or spawning in places that would immediately pop off
